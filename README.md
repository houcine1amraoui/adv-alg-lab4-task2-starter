# Lab 4: Data Structures

## Task 2: Graphs

### Instructions

1. In the graph.py file, complete edge addition in the Graph class constructor to match the graph shown in graph.png. Then, in the main.py file, create a new graph object and display its adjacency list.
2. In the graph.py file, translate the comments in the bfs and dfs methods into Python code. Then, test them out in the main.py, and check out their correctness manually.
3. In the graph.py file, update both bfs and dfs, so that they always explore the neighbors of a node in ascending numerical order.
4. In the main.py, write assertions to confirm the correctness of the updated bfs and dfs methods implementation.
